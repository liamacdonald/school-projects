# School Projects
The contents of this directory include a number of different projects I have worked on throughout my BA and MA programs.  There is not a complete collection of the codes I have written but I have a few R scripts and a few papers that highlight my ability to design statistical and mathematical models as well as my experience implementing some of these types of models.
