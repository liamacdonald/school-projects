# School Projects
The contents of this directory include a number of different projects I have worked on throughout my BA and MA programs.  There is not a complete collection of the codes I have written but I have a few R scripts and a few papers that highlight my ability to design statistical and mathematical models as well as my experience implementing some of these types of models.
The MA thesis is the best representation of my ability working with R as the other two scripts may be hard to understand without greater context that I am not able to make available here.  Each of the papers gives a good understanding of the types of research I was doing and the types of method I am capable of implementing given the right data.
